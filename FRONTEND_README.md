## Objective 🎯
This project required connection to a functional API and using react to create a web site.

## About the project 🔎
  For this project I have created a dental clinic, which works similar to any local dental clinic website, where you can create appointments delete and modify them as a user, as a dentist you have access to your appointments and general appointments, as a user you have access to the data of all users and you can make changes freely within the app.

## Conclusion

We managed to raise and develop the proposed objective of creating a functional dental clinic. It addressed the main aspects of the project as all parts of the game were made using REACT, NODE, SEQUELIZE and JS technologies, the project was fully responsive, as well as having all the features required in the course of geekshubs academy.

I managed to identify the main problems of responsive design, the various problems that arose especially with the management of information and components in react, the difficulties with the consumption of the api of our personal backend project, and the modification of the database itself to access the necessary routes. In spite of these difficulties we managed to adequately address all the functionalities foreseen in the base design of the project.
